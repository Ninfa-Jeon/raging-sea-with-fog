# Raging Sea with Fog and Point Light

* I tweaked a few things onto the "Raging sea" tutorial by Bruno Simon in his course for learning Three.js.
* This is more or less the same in the way it looks at the end of the tutorial but I have added fog and point light to the Shader Material.
* While working on this, I found very few references for how fog and lights need to be implemented for custom shaders and after a few hours of trials and errors, I was left with this.
* I hope thing becomes a reference for someone like me in future.
